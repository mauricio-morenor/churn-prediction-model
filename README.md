## B2B2C Company churn predictor
=========================

### Project Overview

``` 
The project consists on a series of algorithms to predict the seller churn of a Latin
American early stage startup. That operates a B2B2C social commerce marketplace, where 
sellers source products on a mobile app and offer them on social media, while the 
company takes care of the product sourcing, delivery, and payment collection/delivery
thereby eliminating inventory risk in a portfolio of wholesale products.
Due to the nature of the business, seller churn (not placing an order for 30 days)is
quite common. 
This model consists of a churn predictor algorithm that segments sellers who are likely to churn (i.e., not place any orders) each month. This was performed in two (seller retention starting June 2022, y values removed)  iterations, the first one analyzing sellers created after June 2021 and the second one, for sellers created after October 2022. For this document I will focus only on the second one, which is most relevant for the company.
