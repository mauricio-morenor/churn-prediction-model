## B2B2C Company churn predictor
=========================

### Project Overview

``` 
The project consists on a series of algorithms to predict the seller churn of a Latin
American early stage startup. That operates a B2B2C social commerce marketplace, where 
sellers source products on a mobile app and offer them on social media, while the 
company takes care of the product sourcing, delivery, and payment collection/delivery
thereby eliminating inventory risk in a portfolio of wholesale products.
Due to the nature of the business, seller churn (not placing an order for 30 days)is
quite common. 
This model will predict the seller churn, defined as sellers with 1>= orders placed
after june 01 2021, that did not placed an order after may 28 2023.
